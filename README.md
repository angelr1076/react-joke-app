# React Joke App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

React app uses Async/Await and makes API calls with Axios.

You can clone the app and run with 'npm start' in the root folder via the terminal.

Enjoy!

## All API calls where made using the Official Joke API! https://davidtkatz.com
