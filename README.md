# React Joke App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This was practice using React with Async/Await and pulling from an API with Axios.

You can clone the app then move to the root folder in the terminal and run with 'npm run build'

Enjoy!
